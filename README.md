# Hockey Players

This is a simple app that displays a list of hockey players and their stats. It is built using Node.js and Express. It has only three routes:

- `/players` - Displays a list of all players
- `/toronto` - Displays a list of all players who play for the Toronto Maple Leafs
- `/points` - Displays a list of the top 10 players by points
